collaborative sms autoresponder

% node smssage.node.js

will create a gateway (eg. for SMSSync Android App)
and a webservice to determine its responses to text messages.


a new smssage app is initialized with two tabs:
1. setup(ctx): called on startup
2. dispatch(ctx,msg): called on new messages


the context object is passed to each dispatch call,
so that data might perist and be communicable.


messages are evaluated on the server, as well as each client.  any
string returned by the server is sent back to sms sender.

a flag, `ctx.is_server,` is available so that client-side code can be
isolated from server code.
